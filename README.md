# Learning wave2d simulator 

In this repository, I'm going to learn a lightweight 2D wave simulator ([repository](https://github.com/0x23/WaveSimulator2D)) running on the GPU using CuPy library (probably requires a NVIDIA GPU),
which can be used for 2D light and sound simulations.
Here I mainly focus on 2D light simulations.


Here is my plan of going through the codes:
 * Four examples in the [repository](https://github.com/0x23/WaveSimulator2D), forming the [tutorials4ex folder](./tutorials4ex/).
 * Examples that interest me, forming the [interestex folder](./interestex/).
 * Good examples on Youbute, especially the Youtube channel [Huygens Optics](https://www.youtube.com/@HuygensOptics), forming the [huyoptex folder](./huyoptex/).
